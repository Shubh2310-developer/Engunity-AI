            "what is typescript": """**TypeScript** - Comprehensive Overview

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.

**Core Features:**
- **Static Type Checking**: Catch errors at compile time before they reach production
- **Type Inference**: Automatically determines types when not explicitly declared
- **Modern JavaScript Support**: Full support for ES6+ features and future JavaScript proposals
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, and decorators
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Superior autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation

**Key Benefits:**
- **Better Code Quality**: Type system prevents common JavaScript errors
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: IntelliSense, better debugging, and code navigation
- **Easier Refactoring**: Safe code changes across large codebases
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared interfaces and types improve team productivity

**How TypeScript Works:**
1. Write TypeScript code with type annotations
2. TypeScript compiler (tsc) checks types and reports errors
3. Compiles to clean, readable JavaScript
4. Runs anywhere JavaScript runs (browsers, Node.js, etc.)

**Type System Highlights:**
- **Basic Types**: string, number, boolean, array, object
- **Advanced Types**: union types, intersection types, mapped types
- **Interfaces**: Define object shapes and contracts
- **Generics**: Reusable components with type parameters
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking

**Popular Use Cases:**
- **Web Applications**: React, Angular, Vue.js projects
- **Backend Development**: Node.js servers and APIs
- **Desktop Apps**: Electron applications
- **Mobile Development**: React Native apps
- **Library Development**: npm packages and frameworks

**Development Ecosystem:**
- **Frameworks**: Angular (built with TypeScript), supports React/Vue
- **Tools**: VS Code, WebStorm, extensive tooling ecosystem
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha with TypeScript support
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, esbuild integration

**Learning Progression:**
1. Start with basic type annotations
2. Learn interfaces and type definitions
3. Explore advanced types and generics
4. Practice with real projects
5. Configure TypeScript for your workflow""",

            "define typescript": """**TypeScript Definition**

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static type definitions to JavaScript. It's a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Superset of JavaScript**: All existing JS code works in TypeScript
- **Optional Static Typing**: Add types where needed, keep JavaScript where preferred
- **Compile-time Checking**: Catches errors before runtime execution
- **Modern Language Features**: Latest ECMAScript support and proposals
- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Types are completely erased during compilation

**Design Purpose:**
TypeScript was created to address JavaScript's limitations in large-scale application development by providing:
- **Type Safety**: Prevent common programming errors
- **Better Tooling Support**: Enhanced IDE features and developer experience
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Interfaces, modules, and namespaces
- **Improved Maintainability**: Self-documenting code through type annotations""",

            "typescript features": """**TypeScript Key Features**

**Type System:**
- **Static Typing**: Optional type annotations for variables, functions, and objects
- **Type Inference**: Automatically deduces types when not explicitly specified
- **Union and Intersection Types**: Combine types for flexible definitions
- **Literal Types**: Exact string, number, or boolean values as types
- **Mapped Types**: Transform existing types into new ones

**Object-Oriented Programming:**
- **Classes**: ES6+ class syntax with type annotations
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts for objects and classes
- **Inheritance**: Extend classes and implement interfaces
- **Access Modifiers**: public, private, protected visibility
- **Abstract Classes**: Base classes that cannot be instantiated

**Advanced Features:**
- **Generics**: Reusable components with type parameters
- **Decorators**: Meta-programming with annotations
- **Modules**: ES6 module system with type information
- **Namespaces**: Organize code into logical groups
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking functions

**Developer Experience:**
- **IntelliSense**: Advanced autocomplete and suggestions
- **Refactoring**: Safe rename and restructure operations
- **Error Detection**: Compile-time error reporting
- **Navigation**: Go-to-definition and find-all-references
- **Debugging**: Source map support for debugging TypeScript""",

**Your Question:** "{question}"

**What is the 'any' type in TypeScript?**

The `any` type in TypeScript is a type that can represent any JavaScript value. It essentially turns off TypeScript's type checking for that variable.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Disables Type Checking**: Variables with `any` type bypass all type checking
- **Dynamic Typing**: Behaves like JavaScript's dynamic typing
- **Flexible but Risky**: Allows any operation but loses type safety benefits
- **Legacy Code**: Useful when migrating JavaScript to TypeScript

**When `any` is Used:**
```typescript
let value: any = 42;
value = "hello";        // OK
value = true;          // OK
value.foo.bar.baz;     // OK (no compile-time checking)
```

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Migration**: Converting JavaScript code incrementally
- **Third-party Libraries**: When type definitions are unavailable
- **Dynamic Content**: Working with unknown data structures
- **Quick Prototyping**: Rapid development without strict typing

**Why to Avoid `any`:**
- **Loses Type Safety**: Main benefit of TypeScript is eliminated
- **Runtime Errors**: No compile-time error detection
- **Poor IntelliSense**: IDE can't provide accurate suggestions
- **Maintenance Issues**: Harder to refactor and debug

**Better Alternatives:**
- **`unknown`**: Type-safe alternative for truly unknown values
- **Union Types**: `string | number` for specific possibilities
- **Generic Types**: `T` for reusable type-safe components
- **Type Assertions**: `value as string` for specific casting

**Best Practices:**
- Use `any` sparingly and temporarily
- Enable `noImplicitAny` in tsconfig.json
- Gradually replace `any` with specific types
- Document why `any` is necessary when used
