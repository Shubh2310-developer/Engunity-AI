{"id": "cs_000003", "question": "Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose decision to leave causes Alise to be left in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers and animal friends? Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun. On the first night they see the Polar Star and Lord Rogers says that sailors always used this star to guide the way back home. What position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?", "answer": "Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule. In her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \"civilizing mission,\" wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized. Furthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \"obliged and forced to do so.\" In summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.", "primary_module": "code_assistant", "module_relevance_scores": {"code_assistant": 40.3921568627451, "document_qa": 0, "data_analysis": 2.549019607843137, "research_tools": 0, "chat": 0, "notebook": 0, "blockchain": 0}, "quality_metrics": {"length_score": 1, "structure_score": 0.5, "content_score": 0, "technical_score": 0.1, "overall_score": 0.37}, "overall_quality": 0.37, "code_snippets": [], "technical_terms": {"code_snippets": ["inherently", "this", "realize", "uses", "everything", "Rodgers", "their", "Alise", "quickly", "yoga", "chases", "but", "from", "s", "would", "attitudes", "go", "on", "power", "But", "summary", "was", "morning", "have", "rather", "stage", "What", "asleep", "Jean", "sense", "nations", "leaving", "century", "nature", "aggressive", "top", "powers", "escape", "rulers", "just", "cruel", "in", "Puffin", "first", "after", "them", "measure", "do", "tied", "if", "boy", "Queen", "British", "mission", "that", "answer", "Empire", "turned", "He", "very", "Britain", "practice", "creatures", "emphasized", "people", "left", "On", "costume", "forced", "Speed", "only", "changes", "to", "night", "its", "expanding", "expansionist", "causes", "the", "rule", "home", "reinforces", "protection", "be", "some", "adventure", "imperialist", "also", "Inhabited", "proper", "attitude", "claimed", "it", "through", "aligned", "Furthermore", "pirate", "global", "right", "during", "countries", "firmly", "out", "an", "distracting", "always", "fighting", "bring", "question", "needs", "so", "successful", "inhabited", "animal", "called", "before", "conflicts", "building", "well", "Lord", "Derek", "teach", "ship", "Read", "meat", "order", "Unbeknownst", "group", "demanded", "and", "circumstances", "enlightenment", "gone", "Polar", "as", "position", "room", "territories", "Far", "stance", "see", "who", "princess", "took", "ready", "t", "did", "food", "This", "militaristic", "civilizing", "extract", "again", "notch", "act", "like", "duty", "wherein", "way", "maintain", "noises", "help", "a", "shipwrecked", "sneak", "leave", "firm", "island", "love", "palace", "preparedness", "ensuring", "away", "believed", "scavenges", "trying", "guide", "could", "annex", "lessons", "disagrees", "That", "era", "doesn", "bridge", "Star", "has", "care", "how", "friends", "strange", "importance", "begins", "instead", "once", "of", "progress", "decision", "by", "argued", "had", "success", "approach", "placed", "into", "paragraph", "is", "Odette", "used", "prepare", "says", "all", "humanitarian", "they", "served", "policy", "asserting", "outlook", "responsibility", "While", "bed", "he", "Bob", "chance", "military", "achieved", "notices", "protective", "Whose", "furious", "expansion", "her", "same", "benign", "following", "continually", "annexation", "are", "Victoria", "shielding", "secure", "foreign", "obliged", "involved", "She", "obligation", "next", "not", "enters", "colonized", "making", "opinion", "Uberta", "learn", "nervous", "sailors", "negative", "reign", "with", "modern", "back", "necessary", "combination", "were", "populations", "mysterious", "moral", "colonial", "Please", "leading", "for", "swim", "she", "falls", "maintaining", "about", "wars", "native", "force", "sent", "wanted", "fun", "want", "strict", "port", "Scullions", "under", "In", "or", "Rogers", "prevailing", "star", "animals", "influence", "The", "lake", "when", "Boggs", "rate", "towards", "take", "country"]}, "question_length": 352, "answer_length": 260, "has_code": false, "technical_complexity": 1, "processing_metadata": {"original_index": 3, "processed_timestamp": "2025-07-27T13:53:37.506806", "preprocessing_version": "1.0"}, "quality_tier": "low", "cs_topic_scores": {"programming_fundamentals": 0.09375, "algorithms": 0.0, "data_structures": 0.10588235294117647, "software_engineering": 0.0, "machine_learning": 0.0, "natural_language_processing": 0.059375, "database_systems": 0.0, "web_development": 0.0, "computer_networks": 0.03888888888888888, "computer_security": 0.0, "operating_systems": 0.04666666666666666, "human_computer_interaction": 0.0}, "primary_cs_topics": ["programming_fundamentals", "data_structures"], "module_assignment_score": 0.052941176470588235, "assignment_method": "cs_topic_mapping", "contributing_topics": ["data_structures"], "source_module": "research_tools"}
{"id": "cs_000006", "question": "In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\" Answer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?", "answer": "Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.
