{"id": "cs_000005", "question": "Article: This also helps you perform well and appear accomplished, which makes you seem more professional. Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say. Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.

{"id": "cs_000006", "question": "In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\" Answer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?", "answer": "Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.

He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun. On the first night they see the Polar Star and Lord Rogers says that sailors always used this star to guide the way back home. What position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?", "answer": "Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule. In her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \"civilizing mission,\" wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized. Furthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \"obliged and forced to do so.\" In summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.", "primary_module": "code_assistant", "module_relevance_scores": {"code_assistant": 40.3921568627451, "document_qa": 0, "data_analysis": 2.549019607843137, "research_tools": 0, "chat": 0, "notebook": 0, "blockchain": 0}, "quality_metrics": {"length_score": 1, "structure_score": 0.5, "content_score": 0, "technical_score": 0.1, "overall_score": 0.37}, "overall_quality": 0.37, "code_snippets": [], "technical_terms": {"code_snippets": ["inherently", "this", "realize", "uses", "everything", "Rodgers", "their", "Alise", "quickly", "yoga", "chases", "but", "from", "s", "would", "attitudes", "go", "on", "power", "But", "summary", "was", "morning", "have", "rather", "stage", "What", "asleep", "Jean", "sense", "nations", "leaving", "century", "nature", "aggressive", "top", "powers", "escape", "rulers", "just", "cruel", "in", "Puffin", "first", "after", "them", "measure", "do", "tied", "if", "boy", "Queen", "British", "mission", "that", "answer", "Empire", "turned", "He", "very", "Britain", "practice", "creatures", "emphasized", "people", "left", "On", "costume", "forced", "Speed", "only", "changes", "to", "night", "its", "expanding", "expansionist", "causes", "the", "rule", "home", "reinforces", "protection", "be", "some", "adventure", "imperialist", "also", "Inhabited", "proper", "attitude", "claimed", "it", "through", "aligned", "Furthermore", "pirate", "global", "right", "during", "countries", "firmly", "out", "an", "distracting", "always", "fighting", "bring", "question", "needs", "so", "successful", "inhabited", "animal", "called", "before", "conflicts", "building", "well", "Lord", "Derek", "teach", "ship", "Read", "meat", "order", "Unbeknownst", "group", "demanded", "and", "circumstances", "enlightenment", "gone", "Polar", "as", "position", "room", "territories", "Far", "stance", "see", "who", "princess", "took", "ready", "t", "did", "food", "This", "militaristic", "civilizing", "extract", "again", "notch", "act", "like", "duty", "wherein", "way", "maintain", "noises", "help", "a", "shipwrecked", "sneak", "leave", "firm", "island", "love", "palace", "preparedness", "ensuring", "away", "believed", "scavenges", "trying", "guide", "could", "annex", "lessons", "disagrees", "That", "era", "doesn", "bridge", "Star", "has", "care", "how", "friends", "strange", "importance", "begins", "instead", "once", "of", "progress", "decision", "by", "argued", "had", "success", "approach", "placed", "into", "paragraph", "is", "Odette", "used", "prepare", "says", "all", "humanitarian", "they", "served", "policy", "asserting", "outlook", "responsibility", "While", "bed", "he", "Bob", "chance", "military", "achieved", "notices", "protective", "Whose", "furious", "expansion", "her", "same", "benign", "following", "continually", "annexation", "are", "Victoria", "shielding", "secure", "foreign", "obliged", "involved", "She", "obligation", "next", "not", "enters", "colonized", "making", "opinion", "Uberta", "learn", "nervous", "sailors", "negative", "reign", "with", "modern", "back", "necessary", "combination", "were", "populations", "mysterious", "moral", "colonial", "Please", "leading", "for", "swim", "she", "falls", "maintaining", "about", "wars", "native", "force", "sent", "wanted", "fun", "want", "strict", "port", "Scullions", "under", "In", "or", "Rogers", "prevailing", "star", "animals", "influence", "The", "lake", "when", "Boggs", "rate", "towards", "take", "country"]}, "question_length": 352, "answer_length": 260, "has_code": false, "technical_complexity": 1, "processing_metadata": {"original_index": 3, "processed_timestamp": "2025-07-27T13:53:37.506806", "preprocessing_version": "1.0"}, "quality_tier": "low", "cs_topic_scores": {"programming_fundamentals": 0.09375, "algorithms": 0.0, "data_structures": 0.10588235294117647, "software_engineering": 0.0, "machine_learning": 0.0, "natural_language_processing": 0.059375, "database_systems": 0.0, "web_development": 0.0, "computer_networks": 0.03888888888888888, "computer_security": 0.0, "operating_systems": 0.04666666666666666, "human_computer_interaction": 0.0}, "primary_cs_topics": ["programming_fundamentals", "data_structures"], "module_assignment_score": 0.046875, "assignment_method": "cs_topic_mapping", "contributing_topics": ["programming_fundamentals"], "source_module": "notebook"}
