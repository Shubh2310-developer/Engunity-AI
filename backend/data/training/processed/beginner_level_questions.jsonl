{"id": "cs_000003", "question": "Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose decision to leave causes Alise to be left in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers and animal friends? Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun. On the first night they see the Polar Star and Lord Rogers says that sailors always used this star to guide the way back home. What position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?", "answer": "Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule. In her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \"civilizing mission,\" wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized. Furthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \"obliged and forced to do so.\" In summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.", "primary_module": "code_assistant", "module_relevance_scores": {"code_assistant": 40.3921568627451, "document_qa": 0, "data_analysis": 2.549019607843137, "research_tools": 0, "chat": 0, "notebook": 0, "blockchain": 0}, "quality_metrics": {"length_score": 1, "structure_score": 0.5, "content_score": 0, "technical_score": 0.1, "overall_score": 0.37}, "overall_quality": 0.37, "code_snippets": [], "technical_terms": {"code_snippets": ["inherently", "this", "realize", "uses", "everything", "Rodgers", "their", "Alise", "quickly", "yoga", "chases", "but", "from", "s", "would", "attitudes", "go", "on", "power", "But", "summary", "was", "morning", "have", "rather", "stage", "What", "asleep", "Jean", "sense", "nations", "leaving", "century", "nature", "aggressive", "top", "powers", "escape", "rulers", "just", "cruel", "in", "Puffin", "first", "after", "them", "measure", "do", "tied", "if", "boy", "Queen", "British", "mission", "that", "answer", "Empire", "turned", "He", "very", "Britain", "practice", "creatures", "emphasized", "people", "left", "On", "costume", "forced", "Speed", "only", "changes", "to", "night", "its", "expanding", "expansionist", "causes", "the", "rule", "home", "reinforces", "protection", "be", "some", "adventure", "imperialist", "also", "Inhabited", "proper", "attitude", "claimed", "it", "through", "aligned", "Furthermore", "pirate", "global", "right", "during", "countries", "firmly", "out", "an", "distracting", "always", "fighting", "bring", "question", "needs", "so", "successful", "inhabited", "animal", "called", "before", "conflicts", "building", "well", "Lord", "Derek", "teach", "ship", "Read", "meat", "order", "Unbeknownst", "group", "demanded", "and", "circumstances", "enlightenment", "gone", "Polar", "as", "position", "room", "territories", "Far", "stance", "see", "who", "princess", "took", "ready", "t", "did", "food", "This", "militaristic", "civilizing", "extract", "again", "notch", "act", "like", "duty", "wherein", "way", "maintain", "noises", "help", "a", "shipwrecked", "sneak", "leave", "firm", "island", "love", "palace", "preparedness", "ensuring", "away", "believed", "scavenges", "trying", "guide", "could", "annex", "lessons", "disagrees", "That", "era", "doesn", "bridge", "Star", "has", "care", "how", "friends", "strange", "importance", "begins", "instead", "once", "of", "progress", "decision", "by", "argued", "had", "success", "approach", "placed", "into", "paragraph", "is", "Odette", "used", "prepare", "says", "all", "humanitarian", "they", "served", "policy", "asserting", "outlook", "responsibility", "While", "bed", "he", "Bob", "chance", "military", "achieved", "notices", "protective", "Whose", "furious", "expansion", "her", "same", "benign", "following", "continually", "annexation", "are", "Victoria", "shielding", "secure", "foreign", "obliged", "involved", "She", "obligation", "next", "not", "enters", "colonized", "making", "opinion", "Uberta", "learn", "nervous", "sailors", "negative", "reign", "with", "modern", "back", "necessary", "combination", "were", "populations", "mysterious", "moral", "colonial", "Please", "leading", "for", "swim", "she", "falls", "maintaining", "about", "wars", "native", "force", "sent", "wanted", "fun", "want", "strict", "port", "Scullions", "under", "In", "or", "Rogers", "prevailing", "star", "animals", "influence", "The", "lake", "when", "Boggs", "rate", "towards", "take", "country"]}, "question_length": 352, "answer_length": 260, "has_code": false, "technical_complexity": 1, "processing_metadata": {"original_index": 3, "processed_timestamp": "2025-07-27T13:53:37.506806", "preprocessing_version": "1.0"}, "quality_tier": "low"}

{"id": "cs_000006", "question": "In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\" Answer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?", "answer": "Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.

{"id": "cs_000019", "question": "Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

{"id": "cs_000028", "question": "Music Sales Bounce Back, Thanks to The Beatles on iTunes The Beatles' catalog landed on iTunes November 16, after years of rumors, speculation and drama. The deal between Apple, Apple Corps (The Beatles' publisher) and record label EMI is reportedly exclusive through some time this year. What is a short summary of the above article?", "answer": "The Beatles' arrival on iTunes has significantly impacted music sales, leading to a rare year-over-year increase in the United States. The increase in sales can be observed after the Beatles' catalog was made available on iTunes in November. This has led to a growth in catalog music sales, which consist of older music. Digital retailers gained more than half of the sales, while physical album sales continued to decline. This indicates that there is still a significant number of fans who prefer to acquire their music legally and conveniently. The success of the Beatles on iTunes suggests that providing easy access to sought-after music can drive sales and should be considered by other digital music holdouts, such as AC/DC, Garth Brooks, and Bob Seger.", "primary_module": "code_assistant", "module_relevance_scores": {"code_assistant": 34.18994413407821, "document_qa": 0, "data_analysis": 2.011173184357542, "research_tools": 0, "chat": 0, "notebook": 0, "blockchain": 0}, "quality_metrics": {"length_score": 1, "structure_score": 0.5, "content_score": 0, "technical_score": 0.1, "overall_score": 0.37}, "overall_quality": 0.37, "code_snippets": [], "technical_terms": {"code_snippets": ["AC", "made", "this", "such", "Music", "their", "iTunes", "half", "article", "on", "summary", "was", "What", "Bounce", "exclusive", "November", "increase", "in", "record", "after", "Thanks", "that", "Brooks", "physical", "impacted", "acquire", "to", "Back", "DC", "the", "some", "be", "conveniently", "through", "decline", "indicates", "album", "arrival", "led", "providing", "States", "rumors", "still", "year", "other", "prefer", "and", "growth", "as", "deal", "time", "who", "access", "which", "observed", "sales", "landed", "This", "there", "rare", "can", "retailers", "Garth", "a", "over", "EMI", "easy", "continued", "drama", "speculation", "significant", "suggests", "digital", "has", "available", "while", "Apple", "publisher", "of", "older", "success", "fans", "by", "Beatles", "sought", "is", "label", "more", "Sales", "Bob", "should", "United", "consist", "short", "holdouts", "Seger", "than", "Corps", "number", "between", "legally", "drive", "catalog", "reportedly", "gained", "leading", "above", "significantly", "Digital", "The", "considered", "music", "years"]}, "question_length": 55, "answer_length": 124, "has_code": false, "technical_complexity": 1, "processing_metadata": {"original_index": 28, "processed_timestamp": "2025-07-27T13:53:37.528171", "preprocessing_version": "1.0"}, "quality_tier": "low"}

On his last day , Ben's relationship with his co-workers is presumed to be anything but a warm one . None of his colleagues will join him for a drink and a cake in his honor has an iced portion of the phrase `` Good riddance , asshole '' sliced out . Ben's cross-country drive in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady , South Carolina . The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans , who sentences him to community service at a nearby hospital . Ben offers to pay for the fence , but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back . Defeated , he reports to the hospital , where Nurse Packer humbles him by ordering him to clock in and out , as would a factory worker . Though upset , Ben quickly makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson , the town cafe's proprietor/head waitress , and Melvin , the local mechanic tasked with repairing Ben's car . Ben soon finds his clinic work to be much more laid-back than the emergency room . He has simple cases such as spots before the eyes , fishing hook impalings , and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple , whose baby he later delivers . The experience also humbles Ben when he mistreats a case of mitral valve regurgitation leading to late cyanosis in the child .
