{"id": "cs_000005", "question": "Article: This also helps you perform well and appear accomplished, which makes you seem more professional. Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say. Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.
