Your Question: "{question}"

What is PostgreSQL:
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that combines the reliability and stability of traditional relational databases with advanced object-oriented and non-relational features.

Core Features and Capabilities:
PostgreSQL extends the SQL language and combines it with many advanced features that safely store and scale complex data workloads. Key capabilities include:

ACID Compliance:
- Atomicity: Transactions are all-or-nothing operations
- Consistency: Database remains in valid state after transactions
- Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- Durability: Committed transactions persist even after system failures

Advanced Data Types:
- Traditional types: INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN
- Advanced types: JSON, JSONB, XML, UUID, Arrays
- Geometric types: POINT, LINE, POLYGON for spatial data
- Network types: INET, CIDR for IP addresses
- Custom types: User-defined composite and enumerated types

PostgreSQL Architecture:
PostgreSQL uses a sophisticated client/server model with multiple cooperating processes:

Server Process Management:
- Postmaster: Main server process that manages connections and spawns backend processes
- Backend processes: Handle individual client connections and execute queries
- Background processes: Manage system maintenance, checkpointing, and WAL writing
- Shared memory: Buffers and caches shared across all processes

Storage System:
- Tablespaces: Logical storage areas that can span multiple file systems
- Pages: Fixed-size blocks (typically 8KB) that store table and index data
- TOAST: The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique for large field values
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging): Ensures data integrity and enables point-in-time recovery

Query Processing:
- Parser: Analyzes SQL syntax and creates parse trees
- Planner/Optimizer: Determines optimal execution strategy
- Executor: Carries out the query plan and returns results
- Statistics collector: Gathers performance metrics for optimization

Advanced Enterprise Features:
- Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) for high concurrency
- Extensibility through custom functions, operators, and data types
- Full-text search capabilities with advanced indexing
- Partitioning for large tables and improved performance
- Replication: Streaming, logical, and physical replication options
- Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) for accessing external data sources

Database Administration:
- Comprehensive backup and recovery options
- Online maintenance operations
- Performance monitoring and tuning tools
- Security features including SSL, authentication, and row-level security
- Resource management and connection pooling

Modern Development Support:
- Extensive JSON/JSONB support for document-style operations
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions
- Stored procedures in multiple languages (PL/pgSQL, Python, Perl, etc.)
- Triggers and rules for automated data processing
- Full Unicode support with multiple character encodings

This comprehensive overview demonstrates PostgreSQL's position as an enterprise-class database system suitable for applications ranging from small projects to large-scale distributed systems."""

**3. Development Experience**
- **TypeScript**: Superior IDE support, autocomplete, refactoring tools
- **JavaScript**: Basic IDE support, less predictive assistance

**4. Code Organization**
- **TypeScript**: Interfaces, classes, modules with strong typing
- **JavaScript**: Flexible structure, prototype-based inheritance

**Key TypeScript Advantages:**
- **Early Error Detection**: Find bugs before they reach users
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Refactoring Safety**: Change code confidently across large codebases
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared type definitions improve consistency

**When to Choose TypeScript:**
- Large, complex applications with multiple developers
- Long-term projects requiring maintainability
- Enterprise applications with strict quality requirements
- Projects where code reliability is critical

**When JavaScript Might Suffice:**
- Small projects or prototypes
- Simple scripts or utilities
- Projects with rapid iteration requirements
- When team lacks TypeScript experience

**Migration Path:**
1. Rename .js files to .ts
2. Add basic type annotations
3. Configure tsconfig.json
4. Gradually improve type coverage
5. Enable strict mode for maximum safety

*This comparison helps you understand when and why to choose TypeScript over JavaScript for your projects.*"""

**Your Question:** "{question}"

**What is TypeScript?**
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.

**Key Features:**
- **Static Type Checking**: Catch errors at compile time before they reach production
- **Type Inference**: Automatically determines types when not explicitly declared  
- **Modern JavaScript Support**: Full ES6+ features with additional enhancements
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Superior IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring

**Core Benefits:**
- **Error Prevention**: Reduces runtime errors through compile-time checking
- **Code Quality**: Self-documenting code through type annotations
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared interfaces improve development consistency
- **Maintainability**: Easier refactoring and code organization for large projects

**Common Use Cases:**
- Enterprise web applications requiring robust type safety
- Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js
- Backend APIs and services with Node.js
- Library and npm package development

**Getting Started:**
1. Install TypeScript: `npm install -g typescript`
2. Create tsconfig.json for project configuration
3. Write .ts files with type annotations
4. Compile to JavaScript with `tsc` command
