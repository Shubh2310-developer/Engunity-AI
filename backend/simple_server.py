**Core Features:**
• ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
• Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
• Write-ahead logging (WAL) for crash recovery
• Point-in-time recovery and online backups
• Tablespaces for storage management
• Asynchronous replication and streaming replication

**Advanced Data Types:**
• JSON and JSONB for document storage
• Arrays, composite types, and custom data types
• Range types (int4range, tsrange, etc.)
• Network address types (inet, cidr, macaddr)
• Geometric types for spatial data
• Full-text search capabilities

**Query Features:**
• Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and recursive queries
• Window functions and advanced analytics
• Partial and expression indexes
• Foreign keys and check constraints
• Views, materialized views, and updatable views
• Advanced join algorithms (hash, merge, nested loop)

**Extensibility:**
• Custom functions in multiple languages (PL/pgSQL, Python, C, etc.)
• User-defined operators and data types
• Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) for external data sources
• Extensions ecosystem (PostGIS, pg_stat_statements, etc.)

**Performance & Scalability:**
• Query planner with cost-based optimization
• Parallel query execution
• Table partitioning (range, list, hash)
• Connection pooling support
• Advanced indexing (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN)""",
        
        "acid": """PostgreSQL provides full ACID compliance:

**Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

**Consistency:** Database constraints are enforced, ensuring data integrity across all operations.

**Isolation:** Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other. PostgreSQL supports multiple isolation levels:
• Read Uncommitted
• Read Committed (default)
• Repeatable Read  
• Serializable

**Durability:** Once committed, data survives system crashes through write-ahead logging (WAL).""",

        "json": """PostgreSQL offers excellent JSON support:

**JSON vs JSONB:**
• JSON: Stores exact text representation, faster input, supports duplicate keys
• JSONB: Binary format, faster processing, automatic duplicate key removal, indexable

**Key Operations:**
• `->` operator for field access by key
• `->>` operator for field access as text
• `@>` operator for containment checks
• `jsonb_path_query()` for JSONPath expressions

**Indexing:**
• GIN indexes on JSONB columns for fast searches
• Expression indexes on specific JSON fields
• Partial indexes for filtered JSON data

**Example Usage:**
```sql
SELECT data->>'name' as name 
FROM users 
WHERE data @> '{"active": true}';
```""",

        "replication": """PostgreSQL supports multiple replication methods:

**Streaming Replication:**
• Asynchronous and synchronous modes
• Hot standby servers for read-only queries
• Automatic failover capabilities

**Logical Replication:**
• Publication/subscription model
• Selective replication of tables/schemas
• Cross-version compatibility
• Bidirectional replication possible

**Point-in-Time Recovery:**
• Continuous archiving of WAL files
• Recovery to any point in time
• Base backups + WAL replay

**Configuration:**
• wal_level = replica or logical
• max_wal_senders for concurrent connections
• synchronous_standby_names for sync replication""",

        "performance": """PostgreSQL performance optimization features:

**Query Optimization:**
• Cost-based query planner
• Statistics collection (ANALYZE)
• Query plan caching
• Parallel query execution

**Indexing Strategies:**
• B-tree (default) for equality and range queries
• Hash for equality lookups
• GiST/SP-GiST for geometric and full-text search
• GIN for composite values (arrays, JSONB)
• BRIN for large sequential datasets

**Memory Management:**
• shared_buffers for cache
• work_mem for query operations
• maintenance_work_mem for VACUUM/CREATE INDEX
• effective_cache_size for query planning

**Connection Management:**
• Connection pooling (PgBouncer, pgpool-II)
• max_connections tuning
• prepared statements for repeated queries"""
