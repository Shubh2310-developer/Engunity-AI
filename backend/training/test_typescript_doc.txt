TypeScript Type Safety

Type safety in TypeScript refers to the ability to catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime. TypeScript achieves this through static type checking.

Key features of TypeScript type safety:
1. Static type checking - Types are checked before code execution
2. Type annotations - Explicit type declarations help catch errors
3. Type inference - TypeScript can automatically deduce types
4. Interface definitions - Define contracts for object shapes
5. Generic types - Enable type-safe reusable components

Benefits:
- Fewer runtime errors
- Better code documentation  
- Improved IDE support with autocomplete
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

TypeScript's type system helps developers write more reliable JavaScript code by catching potential issues during development.
