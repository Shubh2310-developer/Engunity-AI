# OPAL Agent Integration Guide
## How OPAL Agent Can Help Build AI Agents for Your Backend

### <¯ What is OPAL Agent?

OPAL (Orchestrated Platform for AI Logic) Agent is a powerful platform that allows you to create visual AI workflows by connecting your existing AI agents through a drag-and-drop interface. It acts as a bridge between your sophisticated backend AI systems and visual workflow builders.

### =€ What OPAL Agent Can Do For You

#### 1. **Visual Workflow Creation**
- Create complex AI pipelines through drag-and-drop interfaces
- Connect multiple AI agents in sequence or parallel
- Build conditional logic and branching workflows
- Create reusable workflow templates

#### 2. **Agent Orchestration**  
- Combine different AI agents for multi-step tasks
- Route queries to specialized agents based on content type
- Implement fallback strategies between agents
- Scale agent operations automatically

#### 3. **No-Code AI Development**
- Build sophisticated AI workflows without writing code
- Rapidly prototype and test new AI agent combinations
- Share workflows with non-technical team members
- Deploy workflows to production with one click

#### 4. **Integration Hub**
- Connect to external APIs and services
- Integrate with databases and data sources
- Add human-in-the-loop approval steps
- Export results to various formats and systems

### <× Current Backend Architecture Analysis

Based on the comprehensive scan of your backend, here's what you already have:

#### **Existing AI Agent Infrastructure:**

1. **RAG Agent Orchestrator** (`training/ai_agents.py`)
   - 16 specialized sub-agents working in pipeline
   - Query analysis, multi-perspective generation, fact-checking
   - Citation generation and confidence scoring
   - Memory integration and response formatting

2. **Hybrid RAG Agent** (`app/services/rag/hybrid_rag_agent.py`)
   - Document-first priority with web search fallback
   - Quality assessment and confidence thresholds
   - Multi-source answer combination
   - Adaptive retrieval based on query complexity

3. **Smart RAG Agent** (`app/services/rag/smart_rag_agent.py`)
   - Test-time compute with multiple candidate generation
   - Neural answer scoring and backpropagation learning
   - CS document embeddings for retrieval
   - Gradient-based optimization

4. **OPAL Integration Wrapper** (`training/opal_agent_wrapper.py`)
   - FastAPI service exposing all agents via REST API
   - Multiple agent types with capability discovery
   - Health monitoring and performance metrics
   - Production-ready Docker configuration

#### **Supporting Services:**
- **Document Processing**: Advanced chunking, embedding, and indexing
- **Web Search Integration**: Fallback search with quality assessment  
- **Answer Synthesis**: Multi-perspective generation and merging
- **Confidence Scoring**: Neural networks for answer quality assessment
- **Citation Management**: Automatic source attribution and linking
- **Memory Systems**: Conversation history and context continuity

### =' What You Need for OPAL Integration

Your backend is already well-prepared for OPAL integration! Here's what you need to set up:

#### **1. Install OPAL Dependencies**
```bash
cd /home/ghost/engunity-ai/backend/training
pip install -r opal_requirements.txt
```

#### **2. Start the OPAL Agent Service**
```bash
python opal_agent_wrapper.py
```
This starts a FastAPI service at `http://localhost:8001` with:
- `/query` - Main query processing endpoint
- `/agents` - List available agent capabilities
- `/health` - Service health monitoring
- `/docs` - Interactive API documentation

#### **3. Test the Integration**
```bash
python test_opal_integration.py
```
This runs comprehensive tests to ensure all agents work correctly.

#### **4. Docker Deployment (Production)**
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.opal -t engunity-opal-agents .
docker run -p 8001:8001 engunity-opal-agents
```

### <¨ How to Use OPAL with Your Agents

#### **Step 1: Connect to OPAL Platform**
1. Go to the OPAL platform interface
2. Add a new service connection: `http://localhost:8001`
3. OPAL will automatically discover your available agents

#### **Step 2: Available Agent Types**

1. **Hybrid Agent** - Best for most use cases
   - Combines document search + web search
   - High-quality answers with source attribution
   - Adaptive confidence thresholds

2. **Smart Agent** - Best for technical/complex queries  
   - Multiple candidate generation
   - Neural scoring and optimization
   - Best for programming and CS topics

3. **Orchestrator Agent** - Best for comprehensive analysis
   - Full 16-agent pipeline
   - Academic-level research and citations
   - Multi-perspective analysis

#### **Step 3: Build Workflows**

Example workflow patterns you can create:

**Research Assistant Workflow:**
```
Query ’ Question Analysis ’ Hybrid Agent ’ Fact Checking ’ Format Output ’ Save Results
```

**Code Helper Workflow:**
```  
Code Question ’ Smart Agent ’ Code Validation ’ Example Generation ’ Documentation
```

**Academic Research Workflow:**
```
Research Topic ’ Orchestrator Agent ’ Citation Verification ’ Summary Generation ’ Export PDF
```

### =¡ Recommended OPAL Use Cases
