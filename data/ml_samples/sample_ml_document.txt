Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models for prediction tasks
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment

Neural Networks:
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers that process information.

Deep Learning:
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data.

Common Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing  
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles

Key Challenges:
- Data quality and availability
- Model interpretability
- Computational requirements
- Overfitting and generalization
